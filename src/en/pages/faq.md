## Health and prevention
I highly care for my health and I invite you to do so. No sex is risk free even if protected. **Regular testing** and letting your partners aware if you have any symptoms or are positive to a STD is my main prevention strategy.

I'm vaccinated against **Hepatitis A & B**, **Papillomavirus** (HPV), **Monkeypox**, **COVID-19**, common **flu**.

> You can get tested for free and anonymously in France in CeGIDD. Or if you have the social security/AME you can get to any test lab without rdv nor prescription.
> If you have multiple partners a sti test is recommanded every 3-6 months. Somes vaccines exists against Hepatitis B and HPV. Profilactic treatment exists against HIV (PreP) or againt gonorea... (DoxyPeP).
