## In more details

### A Presence

My name is Maelis Gast, also known as kissmaelis. I am 30 years old and live in Paris. I am often recognized first by my smile. The kind that arrives before words and by a quiet joy that naturally lights up encounters.

I am a soft and radiant woman, with a calm presence that feels reassuring. And then, sometimes, when playfulness is invited, a gentle mischievous spark appears. I love lively, laughter-filled atmospheres, moments where one feels free to be themselves, while also knowing how to slow down, breathe, and take time when it becomes precious.

### Sensuality and Complicity

I feel completely at ease in my body. Sensuality, to me, is a silent language: lingering glances, gestures that answer one another, tension rising slowly until the rest of the world fades away. I enjoy when things unfold with delicacy, when desire is born from listening, respect, and small, meaningful attentions.

### Simple Pleasures

I have a particular fondness for simple yet profound pleasures: sharing a good meal, discovering an offbeat film, getting lost in conversations about life, time, and what moves through us. I enjoy being surprised, gently shifted out of familiar frames, invited into the unexpected.

### Femininity

My femininity is natural, without excessive staging. I feel free, peaceful, and aligned. I have a tattoo that is dear to me; it tells something about who I am, but it does not reveal itself to everyone. I like to be looked at with tenderness, desire, and respect—this rare combination that makes encounters unforgettable.

### Path

My story is shaped by detours and courageous choices. I grew up in the countryside, in a modest and isolated environment, before finding the strength to leave. Paris became a refuge, an anchor point. I studied engineering there and worked for several years as a developer, including time in the Netherlands where I became fluent in Dutch. Then came my transition, a period of deep transformation and truth, which led me to step away from a life already mapped out, to care for my health and move closer to what I truly wanted.

Today, I work part-time in community health and pursue this activity alongside it, as a natural extension of my relationship to others. I am a trans woman: simply, factually, and at peace with it.

### Curiosity

In my daily life, I am curious about everything: spending time with friends, watching delightfully strange films, attending sex-positive or BDSM spaces, meeting singular souls, wandering through Paris without a destination, dreaming, learning countless useless things, creating with my hands: collage, painting, drawing. Paris remains, for me, a refuge, a shifting backdrop, a breath.

### Desires and Projects

My projects are personal and artistic. I want to live according to my impulses, create sensual and thoughtful erotic content, tell fragments of my story, explore ideas that are sometimes strange, sometimes light. I need diversity, freedom, and movement.

### What I Hope You Feel

If you are still reading, I hope you feel a gentle closeness, a quiet curiosity, a calm desire. I cherish encounters that take their time, those that grow through continuity and shared complicity.
