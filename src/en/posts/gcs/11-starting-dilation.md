## Day 6
Freshly out of my first time out of bed and shower ✨
I think it’s quite the same in term of swelling from previous picture 🥰
It was fun getting showered by the nurse 🤭
And the view of my pussy from the bathroom miroir was so nice can’t wait to be back to the hotel for the full body miroir 🥰

1st dilation went good, Dr Bank mesured 15 cm but I was at 16  at the end. Managed to pee as well it was a floood 🤣
My fourchette is a bit swollen like a buble and I’m always worried to pop it when I sit.
Otherwise the swollenness as been stable. I’ll add a picture this afternoon or tomorrow after dilation without betadine and silverderm
Dr Bank said I could 
resume hormones so i didn’t wait long to do so 😍
And I find it funny how much bagage I have, the nurse took all the water
bottle and juices that was in the fridge 🥰 at least it will be useful 
for the douches 😛

***first solo static dilation:***
I ordered breakfast room service for 9AM but woke up at 8… Bad timing for a first day, I took a long time trying to *poop* 💩 Room service was knocking at the door like for 10 min then calling on my phone and I  just started inserting dilator at 9 so bad timing 🤪 But I was ready for nurse visit.
Not too much pain, a bit this morning so I took codeine before dilation. Was able to reach 15 cm in 5 minutes, I’m not rushing. Was at 16cm at the end of dilation.
