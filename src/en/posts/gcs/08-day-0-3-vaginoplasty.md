## Day 0
I’m awake after a good night, thx the sleeping pill, waiting for the nurses to shave me 🤗
The enema was not terrible yesterday, I did 6 rounds and she was happy on the 6th. The nurse didn’t spoke English but used google  translate, the word ‘enema’ was translated to ‘garden’ which was fun. 
Some misunderstanding sometimes but it was in a funny way she was absolutely lovely 🥰

## Day 1
Dr Bank visited me this morning, said he did good aesthetic and good depth doesn’t know what it means haha.
The day of operation was a pain in the ass I had to ask for painkiller and was uncomfortable. Today is better !!
Both my arm were numb and weak, my left one was falling and hitting everything. Today a physio came two times to do some exercises to improve that 🙂

## Day 2
A bit of bleeding 
today but bank said it was normal. I feel good, no pain and no 
inconfort. I’m getting strength back in my arms.
They removed a bit of bandage where I have a reaction to the glue. 
Pretty tipical I guess, it hurts on the touch otherwise is fine 😌

## Day 3
Today is day 3 I feel really sleepy, it’s difficult writing this message !!
