## Dr Bank preop consult 
Just arrived at the hospital, I’ve met Dr Bank like 10 mins ago.
He first checked my penis, asked if I did tuck, I said that I did a bit 
but not too tight. He *didn’t say* I have a small penis.
I had prepared some questions about my preferences with printed pictures
and comment on it. So he can told me what possible or not. It didn’t 
feel rushed as some people experienced, I could ask all my questions. 
All I imagined from by current equipment as been confirmed by him.
I had quite a *large* penis before hrt: aroused length about 16 cm and
girth about 46 mm (circumference 136 mm) I have a mold of my dick 
lmao and after almost 3 years of hrt my penis has shrunk quite a bit, 
most obviously when aroused, size when flaccid is: length 11 cm 
without stretching, girth 36 mm (circumference 90 mm).
I’m not circumcised so he told me I could have pink tissue.
I asked about width of anterior and he said it’s gonna be wide (it 
depends of what you have). I asked about 16 cm depth (3rd choice) I 
don’t really care, he asked about my height because this depends on that
as well. He told what’s guaranteed is 13/14 cm.
Also I asked if my urethra will be wide and he said yes because of my 
size. I’m not the most girthy but neither the least so I expect a big 
one. Could be reduced later but he said the risk is necrosis and 
stenosis of the urethra if he remove too much tissue around it.
I asked about length of hood compared to length of labia minora. He 
told me depending on how high your penis is and how long it is the 
entrance of the vaginal canal will be more or less far from the anus. 
The more close to the anus the most straight the canal will be and the 
easier dilation will be. He told me I have long so I could chose between
short or long but I said long (I’m not sure he will have done short).
I asked for *not too big* labia majora and he said with my current bmi
(22) he can remove a bit of fat tissue.

## Anaesthesiologist consult
I had the guy, general anesthesia, I’m taking SSRI at night. Surgery 
should start around 8:30 am, duration of surgery about 5 to 6 hours + 1 
hour in the wake up room (post-op edit: no memories from the wake up 
room) . He ask if I normally took sleeping pill I said I used 
benzodiazepine sometimes and he asks if I want some tonight I said yes. 
Because I said I have asthma (pollen allergies) they took my salbutamol 
inhaler and they will give me puff before anesthesia (never did that in 
my previous surgeries but why not, my asthma is not too wild).
