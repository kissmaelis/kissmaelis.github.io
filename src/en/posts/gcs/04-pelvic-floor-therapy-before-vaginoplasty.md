## Pelvic floor relaxing
I’ve started pelvic floor therapy 3 weeks ago. My therapist assessed the mobility of my legs, back, and pelvis. It turns out I’m not very mobile in those areas, so doing some exercises could be beneficial. Tightness in these muscles might also affect my pelvic floor muscles. I want to prevent that and prepare for the possibility of having a tense pelvic floor after surgery, which could make dilations easier to manage.
She gave me advice on how to pee and poop in ways that protect the pelvic floor:

**While peeing:** Avoid pushing and don’t urinate too frequently. Aim for a minimum interval of every 2 hours but no more than 4 hours between urinations to prevent UTIs. This helps prevent the bladder from becoming hypersensitive, which could make you feel the urge to pee even when the bladder is not full, leading to unnecessary straining that can harm the pelvic floor. Contracting your bladder is a reflex not conscious.

**While pooping:** Avoid pushing and don’t delay when you feel the urge to go. Use a toilet stool to support proper posture and reduce 
muscle strain during bowel movements. This can be especially helpful post-surgery to avoid unnecessary pushing. Preventing constipation is crucial, eat foods high in insoluble fiber to keep your bowels regular.

She also advised me to incorporate some stretching and mobility exercises to improve flexibility around the pelvic floor and prevent it from becoming hypertense. This is to be done prior to the surgery, I will learn later new exercises and dilations tips for post-op. The clinic says **NOT **to do *Kegel* exercises, which makes sense. Some of the following exercises can be found as *Reverse Kegel* exercises on [wikihow](https://www.wikihow.com/Do-Reverse-Kegels).

### Daily Stretching Exercises (30 to 60 seconds each):
**Seated Butterfly Stretch:** Sit with the soles of your feet touching. Keep your back straight and lean forward slightly while gently
pushing down on your knees. You should feel a stretch in your inner thighs.
**Supine Glute Stretch: ** Lie on your back and take your right knee with your left hand. Pull it across your body and towards you to stretch your gluteal muscles.

**Hip Flexor Stretch:** Place your left knee on the floor and your right foot in front of you, with your right knee bent. Lean forward into your right knee to stretch your inner hip. Spread your legs wide for a deeper stretch. This can also be done dynamically if referred.

### Mobility Exercises (10, 15, or 20 repetitions daily):

**Sphinx Position:** Lie on your stomach and push up gently with your forearms to mobilize your back.
**Hip Mobilization:** Lie on your back with your legs bent. Move your hips forward while breathing in and backward while breathing out. Make sure you are only moving your hips and not pushing with your legs.

### Muscle Wake-up Exercises (lying down):
**Deep belly breathing**: Inhale allowing the belly to gently expand, and exhale while gently pulling the navel toward the spine. Can be done with knees bent or with a cushion under the knees. 5 to 10 repetitions. 
Lying on your back or on your side.
**Ankle pumps**: Legs extended, stretch toes toward the end of the bed, then pull them back toward yourself. 20 to 30 repetitions. 
Coordinate with breathing: inhale – stretch // exhale – flex.
**Quad sets**: Legs extended, try to press the back of the knees into the mattress by straightening the legs, toes pointing toward yourself. 
20 to 30 repetitions. Coordinate with breathing: inhale – relax // exhale –  stretch legs.
**Glute sets**: Legs extended, press the heels gently into the mattress with toes pointing toward yourself. 20 to 30 repetitions. 
Coordinate with breathing: inhale – relax // exhale – gently push against the mattress.
### Urination Strategy:
- Sit on the toilet with feet flat on the ground
- Place a hand in warm water
- Gently pour water over the vulva 
- Deep breathing

**Never push into pain**, as it may trigger a reflex contraction of the pelvic floor muscles. If possible, do contract/relax exercises: Contract the pelvic floor muscles, then relax. During relaxation, the pelvic floor muscles are easier to stretch and dilate using the  dilator. This exercise can be combined with deep breathing: Inhale while contracting, exhale while relaxing, and try to insert the dilator a little deeper, always staying within your pain threshold.
**How to contract the pelvic floor muscles:** Place a finger on the central fibrous core of the perineum (the external area of skin between the vulva and the anus) and try to contract the perineum as if holding in urine or gas. During contraction, you should feel the perineum pull inward, away from the finger.
