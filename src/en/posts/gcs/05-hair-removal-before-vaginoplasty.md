## Hair removal
I did a few laser hair removal sessions starting 2 years pre-op. I didn't do everything, mostly sides/perineum. I started doing 
electrolysis hair removal like 8 months preop because I had quite a lot of blond hairs down there. Just doing perineum to prevent hair growing at the entrance. I do it because i don't have to pay for it in my country.
